# ESP8266 Snowflakes
**KiCAD and FreeCAD files for RGB(W) snowflakes**

KiCAD schematic and PCB layout files (along with associated Gerber files) for ESP8266-based RGB(W) snowflakes.  

FreeCAD files for 3D printed diffuser (use clear filament).

Each snowflake uses 25 SK6812 (for RGBW) or WS2812b pixels.
Can be operated using the fantastic [ESPixelStick firmware](https://github.com/forkineye/ESPixelStick) in conjunction with a program such as XLights64.

Unmodified ESPixelStick firmware should work with RBG pixels.

If using RGBW pixels, modified firmware is necessary (I may put up a fork at some point in the future).

**Note:**  I have not actually made a batch of PCBs from these exact files.  I built PCBs using an earlier version, and these files include all of the changes I've made to correct mistakes in the original batch.  Use at your own risk!
